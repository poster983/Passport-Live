## Receiving users  

On the `Students arriving` tab, you will find every pass that has been requested to you from today.  
### Accept a pass 
Click on the "<svg style="height: 1.8em;width: 1.8em;"><g id="check"><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"></path></g></svg>" button.  
### Cancel/Deny a pass

~~The user may be notified by email.~~ (Not implemented as of v0.12.1)  

### Check in 
Checking the user in is important as it lets the administration know that the user is accounted for.  They can also see the duration the user spent in "limbo" (the user is not under any teacher's supervision) and by checking them in, you stop the timer.  
To do this, click on the "<svg style="height: 1.8em;width: 1.8em;"><g id="accessibility"><path d="M12 2c1.1 0 2 .9 2 2s-.9 2-2 2-2-.9-2-2 .9-2 2-2zm9 7h-6v13h-2v-6h-2v6H9V9H3V7h18v2z"></path></g></svg>" button.
