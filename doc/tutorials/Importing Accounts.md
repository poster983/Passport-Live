# How to import accounts into Passport  

## Excel 
This will probably be the most familiar to schools with school management software already in use.  Most will allow you to export your students and faculty account data right into an excel spreadsheet.

Once you have your excel book file with account data, you can start preparing the data.

1. Make a new sheet tab and copy over the data from the exported sheet tab.  
2. Row 1 must be the column  names. See the end of the file for examples. Please see [this](./global.html#accountImport) for descriptions of the column  names.


Example: 
| name.first  |  name.last  |  name.salutation  |  email  |   

NOTE: Column  order does NOT matter
